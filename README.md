# DC Tower-Elevators
About the solution:
* The elevators does not stop between the starting and the destination floors.
* I assumed travelling between floors takes 1 second time. 
* In every second will be searched for free elevators to the queueing requests.
* Always the closest free elevator is called to the starting destination.

* I could improve the solution by gathering more passangers on the DOWN way (so I would use the direction as an input).
